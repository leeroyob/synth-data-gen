# Synthetic Data Generator - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Build a synthetic data generator that:
- Takes engineering symbol images (PNGs with transparent backgrounds)
- Places them randomly on 22x34 inch engineering sheets (landscape)
- Applies realistic distortions to simulate hand-drawn/scanned conditions
- Outputs paired images and annotations for ML training

## Technology Stack Recommendation
**Recommendation: Sonnet 3.5 is sufficient for this project**

Reasoning:
- This is primarily an image processing and data generation pipeline
- Uses standard libraries (PIL/Pillow, OpenCV, NumPy)
- No complex architectural decisions or novel algorithms required
- Clear specifications and straightforward implementation
- Similar to many existing synthetic data generation tools

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Image Library**: Use Pillow as primary, with OpenCV for advanced transforms
2. **Coordinate System**: Use pixel coordinates (not inches) internally
3. **Symbol Scaling**: Maintain aspect ratios, scale relative to sheet size
4. **Randomization**: Use configurable ranges for all parameters
5. **Output Format**: Keep annotations model-agnostic as specified

## Potential Challenges
- Ensuring bounding boxes remain accurate after transformations
- Balancing realism vs. training effectiveness in distortions
- Memory management for large batch generation
- Maintaining performance with high-resolution images

# TODO: Triple Symbol Density Per Page

## Analysis
- Current density range: 5-15 symbols per image
- Need to triple this to: 15-45 symbols per image
- Current collision padding: 10 pixels
- May need to reduce collision padding to fit more symbols

## Plan
- [ ] 1. Update config.json to triple the density_range from [5, 15] to [15, 45]
- [ ] 2. Reduce collision_padding_pixels from 10 to 5 to allow tighter packing
- [ ] 3. Test generation to ensure symbols still fit properly
- [ ] 4. Validate that collision detection still works correctly
- [ ] 5. Generate sample images to verify the increased density

## Key Configuration Changes
- `symbol_placement.density_range`: [5, 15] â†’ [15, 45]
- `symbol_placement.collision_padding_pixels`: 10 â†’ 5

## Technical Considerations
- **Collision Detection**: Reduced padding may increase placement failures
- **Symbol Overlap**: Need to ensure symbols don't overlap inappropriately
- **Placement Success Rate**: Monitor failed_placements statistic
- **Visual Quality**: Ensure increased density doesn't harm training data quality
